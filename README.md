# tuts-for-freshmen

Wazzup! I'm a 2nd year student in Technological University of the Philippines - Manila, BS Computer Science. I actually made these files to help incoming freshmen in our school. But then I thought... why not make it available online so that other freshmen out there may use these as guides/references too.

There are "comments" inside those files to help you understand the contents easier. I hope this may help you survive your first year in college.

If problem persists...

For TURBO C USERS:
  Try inserting a "return 0;" at the end of the code before the main functions end bracket.
  
For DevC USERS:
  Try inserting the needed library/ies. Though I made sure I only used functions from the stdio.h library.
