# tuts-for-freshmen

Wazzup! I'm a 2nd year student in Technological University of the Philippines - Manila, BS Computer Science. I actually made these files to help incoming freshmen in our school. But then I thought... why not make it available online so that other freshmen out there may use these as guides/references too.

There are "comments" inside those files to help you understand the contents easier. I hope this may help you survive your first year in college.
